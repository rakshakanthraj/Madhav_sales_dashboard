✅ Recommendations

1)Investigate Negative Profit Months

  Conduct a detailed review of July and September transactions to identify causes for losses—such as returns, high discounts, or logistics costs.

2)Expand High-Performing Categories

  Products like Printers and Bookcases show strong profitability—consider increasing inventory or marketing efforts for these.

3)Target High-Converting States

  Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh show high sales volume—run localized campaigns or optimize delivery networks in these regions.

4)Leverage Popular Payment Methods

  Since UPI and COD are preferred by most customers, ensure smooth transaction experiences and consider incentives for prepaid methods to reduce COD costs.

5)Customer Loyalty Program

  Introduce a loyalty program to reward top customers like Harivansh, encouraging repeat purchases and brand advocacy.

6)Push Clothing Sales with Bundles

  As Clothing is the highest in quantity sold, consider bundle offers or upsells to increase average order value and margin.
